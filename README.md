# Model of Bioproductivity and Carbon Accunulation by Artificial Pine Ecosystems in the Belarussian Polessie (1999-2006)

The work is devoted to study of carbon stocks formation in man-made pine phytocenoses of Belarus. The influence of forestry and changes of environment conditions on carbon deposition are detected. Imitating model of carbon dynamic in the pine forests was designed. A system of actions allowing to raising efficiency of existing and specially established forest plantations for overcoming a greenhouse effect are offered.
